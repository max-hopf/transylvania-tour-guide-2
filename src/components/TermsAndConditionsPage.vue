      <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to all trips and travel services arranged for or provided to you (“client”, “participant”, “you,” or “your” which terms shall be deemed to refer to you and all the persons named on the booking), by Village Coffee &amp; Travel (“we”, “us” or “our”). Please read them carefully, as they set out your contract with us once you have paid your deposit (or any subsequent payment).</p>
      <h2>1. Booking policy</h2>
      <p><b>1.1.</b> To book a trip with us you must first contact us to discuss your itinerary and request a quotation.<br>
      <b>1.2.</b> After our initial conversation, if you would like our team to proceed with planning your trip and creating a customised itinerary, we will require receipt of an itinerary development fee of 300 EUR. Because of the time and attention we put into handcrafting each journey, this fee serves as an agreement that you are dedicated to working with us. This fee will be credited toward your final balance, but is not refundable should you decide to cancel.<br>
      <b>1.3.</b> After we have received your itinerary development fee, we will propose a specific itinerary with the dates or date range based on your availability. We will be ready to discuss itinerary details and will continue to make adjustments based on your feedback. Once you have approved the proposed itinerary, we will check availability and prices of the travel services included and provide you with an exact trip cost.<br>
      <b>1.4.</b> Once the itinerary and trip cost have been agreed and in order to secure a booking, we require a deposit of 25% of the total trip price. If the booking is made less than thirty (30) days before departure, the full price of the trip will be payable on booking. In some cases, the deposit may be higher if there are larger non-refundable supplier amounts due, but we will let you know at the time of booking if this is necessary. Please note that until we have received your deposit payment, all arrangements are subject to availability and/or price change.<br>
      <b>1.5.</b> Once we receive the deposit we will issue a written confirmation of the booking, at which point a binding contract is formed between us.</p>
      <h2>2. Changes by you</h2>
      <p><b>2.1.</b> If, after we have confirmed a booking, you request a change in the dates or elements of your itinerary we will do our best to meet your revised requirements. If the requested amendments are possible, you will be provided with a quote including any additional costs imposed by our suppliers if applicable.<br>
      <b>2.2.</b> Any such requests received within 15 days before the trip start date will be treated as a cancellation and re-booking and thus subject to cancellation charges.</p>
      <h2>3. Payment</h2>
      <p><b>3.1.</b> The outstanding balance of the total trip price shall be payable no later than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the tour. If the balance payment is not received by the due date, Village Coffee &amp; Travel reserves the right to release your booking and assumes that the trip has been cancelled by you. In this case, our standard cancellation fees would apply.<br>
      <b>3.2.</b> Payments to Village Coffee &amp; Travel must be made in the currency of the invoice by wire transfer directly into the bank account of Village Coffee &amp; Travel (the bank details will be mentioned in the invoice) or by Visa/Mastercard through a secured payment link sent by email. You will be responsible for any bank charges that may be incurred.</p>
      <h2>4. Prices</h2>
      <p><b>4.1.</b> All prices are quoted in EURO, unless otherwise noted.<br>
      <b>4.2.</b> The price of the trip is based on costs known at the date of booking and on relevant rates as at that date, it is subject to variation only to reflect subsequent increases in transportation costs (including fuel and air fares), dues, taxes (including VAT) and fees chargeable for services or adverse exchange rate variations.<br>
      <b>4.3.</b> Even in the above cases, Village Coffee &amp; Travel will not increase the price if the fluctuations are less than 2%, but if the necessary price increases exceed that level then we will notify you accordingly and reserve the right to charge you that extra amount up to a maximum of 8%. If the increase is in excess of 8% of the total cost, you will have the right to cancel the trip and we will give you a full refund of all money paid to the company less the initial non-refundable itinerary development fee of 300 EUR. However, you must advise Village Coffee &amp; Travel in writing within 5 days of receiving the increased invoice in order to cancel your trip.</p>
      <h2>5. Cancellation by you</h2>
      <p><b>5.1.</b> Cancellation instructions by you must be in writing by email to <a href="mailto:transylvanica@gmail.com">transylvanica@gmail.com</a> or to our postal address, and will be effective on the day we receive them.<br>
      <b>5.2.</b> As we incur costs from the time of your booking, the following cancellation charges will be applied. Cancellation charges apply as a percentage of the total trip price, as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cancel more than 90 days prior to trip start date – full refund (minus 300 Euros retained for itinerary development fee)</li>
        <li>Cancel between 90 – 30 days prior to trip start date – 25% cancellation charges will apply (deposit only)</li>
        <li>Cancel between 30 – 15 days prior to trip start date – 75% cancellation charges will apply</li>
        <li>Cancel less than 15 days prior to trip start date – 100% cancellation charges will apply</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>For groups larger than 6 participants, special booking and cancellation policies apply. Please contact us for further information.</b></p>
      <p><b>5.3.</b> Where we have informed you that the booking of a specific travel service included in the tour is non-cancellable, no refund will be made for the cancellation of that particular travel service. Nevertheless, we will do our best to obtain a measure of refund for you from the supplier if possible.<br>
      <b>5.4.</b> In the event that the cancellation charges of the suppliers we use are more than ours, then the suppliers’ cancellation terms will apply.<br>
      <b>5.5.</b> If a participant cancels in a double occupancy room, the remaining participant must pay the single supplement unless otherwise specified.<br>
      <b>5.6.</b> No allowance or refund is provided for unused meals, accommodation, transport, or other pre-paid services, when these are included in the trip price nor once the trip has started can we give any refunds for cancelling part of the trip.<br>
      <b>5.7.</b> You may transfer your booking to another person who satisfies all the conditions applicable to your travel contract. We must receive at least 7 days’ written notice from you in order to make such a transfer. Any additional fees, charges or other costs incurred as a result of transferring your booking will be passed on to you with these costs being advised to you before we effect any transfer.<br>
      <b>5.8.</b> Some tours are based on minimum numbers of passengers travelling; if the number of passengers falls below the minimum required, a surcharge may be imposed or the tour cancelled.<br>
      <b>5.9.</b> Cancellation charges will not be applied where you cancel due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances (as defined in section 8 below) occurring at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity and significantly affecting the performance of the package or your transport to the destination. In this event you will be entitled to a full refund of any payments made for the package but will not be entitled to any additional compensation.<br>
      <b>5.10.</b> Please note that if the reason for your cancellation is covered under the terms of your insurance policy, you may be able to reclaim some or all of the cancellation charges. Please speak to your insurance provider.</p>
      <h2>6. No Shows</h2>
      <p>Failure to travel without prior notification is considered a no-show and the entire cost of reservation is non-refundable.</p>
      <h2>7. Changes and cancellations by us</h2>
      <p><b>7.1.</b> If, before the start of the trip, we are constrained by circumstances beyond our control to alter significantly any of the main characteristics of the travel services specified in itinerary (for example: the travel dates, the change of the accommodation unit category, the price), or cannot fulfil your special requirements that we have accepted in your booking confirmation, we will notify you as soon as  possible. Within the period that we shall specify in the notice, you may either: accept the proposed changes; or terminate the contract without paying a cancellation charge. If you terminate the contract and do not accept a substitute package, you will be entitled to a full refund within 14 days after the contract is terminated.</p>
      <p><b>7.2.</b> You acknowledge and accept that the nature of the private tour offered by us emphasizes unique, personalized, and culturally immersive experiences, many of which involve interactions with local individuals, families, artisans, and hosts. These experiences are subject to the availability and willingness of local partners, who may occasionally become unavailable due to unforeseen personal, cultural, or logistical reasons. In such cases, we reserve the right to modify or substitute certain non-essential experiences with comparable alternatives that maintain the spirit and value of the original activity. These substitutions will be communicated to you as soon as possible, will be of equal or higher value where feasible, and will not affect the core nature or quality of the travel package. You agree to a reasonable degree of flexibility in the itinerary, especially in rural or community-based settings where unpredictability is part of the experience. These changes will not be considered a failure to perform under the contract unless they significantly alter essential travel services, as defined by Directive (EU) 2015/2302 and Romanian law.</p>
      <p><b>7.3.</b> Although we strive to avoid canceling your trip, there may be rare occasions when it becomes necessary (unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances included), and we reserve the right to do so. In such cases, we will make every effort to offer you alternative arrangements of comparable or superior quality. If only a lower-quality option is available, we will offer you an appropriate price reduction, proportionate to the difference in quality. If no alternative can be offered, we will issue a full and prompt refund for the price of the trip.</p>
      <p><b>7.4.</b> We reserve the right to terminate the holiday arrangements of any person whose behaviour is such that it is likely, in our reasonable opinion or tour leader, hotel manager, or other person in authority, to cause distress, danger, damage, or annoyance to other participants, staff, and property or to any third party. Should this happen, full cancellation charges will apply, and we will have no responsibility whatsoever for any costs incurred for the continuation of the holiday, including any return travel, or to compensate for any loss incurred.</p>
      <h2>8. Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances</h2>
      <p>Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances (UEC) refer to situations beyond the control of the parties, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken by the affected party.

In the event that Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances occur, we will notify you as soon as possible. While we will make every effort to offer alternative arrangements, we may need to modify or cancel the travel package. You will be entitled to a full refund or, if available, a substitute package, in accordance with applicable regulations. No compensation will be due in the case of Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances, as defined above, in accordance with Romanian and European Union regulations governing package travel.</p>
      <h2>9. Insurance</h2>
      <p>The trip price does not include travel insurance. We strongly recommend you to purchase comprehensive travel insurance and make sure that all of the activities which you will be carrying out are covered under such insurance, protecting against unforeseen circumstances that could interfere with your travels. Cover must include medical expenses and repatriation in the event of accident or illness. In addition, we recommend that you have cover for personal belongings, overseas legal expenses and cancellation, flight or other transportation delays, personal liability.
